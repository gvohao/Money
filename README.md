# MunnyApp


MunnyApp was an attempt of creating stock chart app that contains elements of personal finance educational methodology. The app allows users to return charts traded in the american market through the search bar and provides charts of index ETFs on the homepage for easy viewing. On its side bar it is intended to return the latest market news but can be repurposed to play curated financial education resources. The is space on the side bar for advertisements or other content for easy access.

Features:
Search and return charts using ticker symbols.
Video player that can be repurposed for various uses.
'Brokerage' page that can help users understand the options they have and how they can get started. (Given more time, would like to create an analysis of pros and cons of these as starting one's investing journey is always the hardest (and the first step to start would preferably be to create an account.).
Clicking on these cards bring you to the websites of the said brokerages to understand more and hopefully embark on one's investment journey.

# MunnyApp


MunnyApp was an attempt of creating stock chart app that contains elements of personal finance educational methodology. 

The application allow users to search charts traded in the american market by entering ticker symbols in the search bar while providing charts of major indexes on the landing page for easy references. On its side bar, I have intended for it to return the latest market news while keeping the option of it being repurposed to play curated financial education resources. The use of the sidebar to as an advertisement space is also demonstrated with a banner that redirects users when clicked on.

The application also feature the various brokerages that is available to Singaporeans should they be interested in embarking on their financial/ investment journey. 

Features:
Search and return charts using ticker symbols.
Video player that can be repurposed for various uses.
'Brokerage' page that can help users understand the options they have and how they can get started. (Given more time, would like to create an analysis of pros and cons of these as starting one's investing journey is always the hardest (and the first step to start would preferably be to create an account.).
Clicking on these cards bring you to the websites of the said brokerages to understand more and hopefully embark on one's investment journey.
